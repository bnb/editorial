# How to Submit Cute Animals in Clothes to Our Tumblr

to be featured on our [tumblr blog](http://meetthehoodies.tumblr.com/)?

Fantastic! By navigating to the blog, [http://meetthehoodies.tumblr.com/](http://meetthehoodies.tumblr.com/), you
should find a link in the sidebar on the right, titled "submit a post".

world can see who came up with that cute picture.

That's it! You're all done, thanks for contributing, and please think of us the
next time you find a cute animal wearing clothes. (We :sparkling_heart: hoodies, but
are accepting of all kinds of clothing).
