# How To Submit Your Blog Post

**TODO**: write up a step-by-step process on how to submit a blog post to this repo. we should assume very little knowledge, and therefore show this process using only the github.com website. quick overview:

* tell writer that this assumes nothing is known about this process, and not to feel scared. for writers who already know all this, we should just offer a quick note at the top that all they have to do is add a markdown file to a certain place and send a PR.
* tell writer that they should feel free to start writing the post in whatever workflow is easiest for them, so that they aren't impeded by tech
* instructions on how to fork this repository
* instructions on creating and editing the markdown file on github.com (in a `posts/` folder, maybe?), including links to markdown documentation
* instructions on how to send a pull request (including asking them to mention the issue number in the pull request description)
* ask them to provide updates on the writing status, i.e. is this just part of the writing, a first draft, a final, etc.
* let them know about our editing process, which consists of github comments on the pull request.
